# PULSE (Predictive Urban Logistics & Simulation Engine)

PULSE is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated urban traffic simulation framework. It enables detailed lane-level modeling of vehicles, with macro and microscopic views. It is integrated with a 3D visualization engine for interactive rendering and analysis.. The  main simulation core is in CUDA

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. First of all, it will download aall the `vcpkg` packages and build them sequentially. This can take a lot of time (about 30-45min) and internet resource(1GB).
2. Change the location of Shaders and osm file path in the `main.cpp` file according to your device.
3. Use the `x64` Architecture option in the VS22.
4. Use the windows 10 Toolkit. (although it can handle win7 also).

### 📌 Requirements

- **C++11**
- **CUDA Toolkit 11.x or higher** -> **Not decided yet!!**
- **Visual Studio 2022** (for Windows dev)
- **Assimp**, **GLFW3**, **GLAD**, **ImGui**, **stb_image**, **Boost/Asio**, **libosmium**,

---

### 🚀 Build Instructions (Windows)

1. **Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PULSE.git
cd PULSE
```

2. **Open `simulation.sln` in Visual Studio**
3. Check the setup instruction above.
4. **Build and Run** using `x64-Debug` or `x64-Release` mode

## 💡 Core Modules

### 🧠 CUDA Simulation Engine
- Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)
- Road parsing from `.osm` files

### 🛰️ Networking Layer
- client-server architecture
- Windows client sends visualization input
- Linux server runs CUDA simulation and sends back traffic state

### 🎮 3D Visualization Engine
- Built with OpenGL
- Draws roads, lanes, buildings from OSM
- ImGui-based interactive debugging UI
- Camera control, real-time rendering

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to make PULSE better!

### Guidelines:
- Follow C++17 conventions
- Use `camelCase` for variable names
- Avoid pushing DLLs or build artifacts
- Document new features in `README.md` and code comments
- Avoid pushing to main branch directly.
